Creating a README on GitHub is a simple process. Here are the steps:

Click the "Create new file" button located in a new github repository (your username).

In the "Name your file" field, enter "README.md" (without the quotes).

Feel free to copy and paste anything you liked from my readme (Customizing it to fit your own theme and stats)

Once you've added all the content, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the "Commit new file" button.

Your README will now be visible on the main page of your repository. -->
